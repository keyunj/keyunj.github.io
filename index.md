<h2 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px;">About Me</h2>

From 2023 to now, I acted as a researcher of AI infra in Huawei to develop heterogeneours traing and inference framework
for accelerating.  
I obtained my Ph.D. from 2017 to 2023 at [Tsinghua University (THU)](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), supervised by Prof.
Jie Zhou and Asst. Prof. [Jianjiang Feng](http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jfeng). I received B.Eng in the Department of
Automation at THU from 2013 to 2017.
